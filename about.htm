<p><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Stephanie</span></strong><br /> Fifteen years ago, I started my practice as Indigo Rising.  That beautiful, deep, majestic blue that you couldn’t quite put your finger on-and it was fitting--as I was discovering myself on my own journey--it fit. That aspect of myself that I knew had so much potential but I was still getting my bearings (...and in so many ways, I am still a growing human being...)</p>
<p>In 2017, after a short hiatus, it was time I reinvented myself.  I did that in the little city of Savannah, GA, which will always have a piece of me.  I converted a little office in my other business and aptly just kept calling it “The Healing Room”, because that is what it was.  It was a space to pray, to grow, to meditate, to learn and ultimately, to heal. I moved out of that office in early 2018 and still continued my life’s work, my spiritual work.</p>
<p>After a wonderful year of personal growth and change--I picked up and moved across the country to where you will find me now, Austin, TX--dubbed by me--as the land of opportunity.  I harrowed over a name that would fit my mission--taking something that may be a challenge of personal growth in one’s life, and turning it into something even more beautiful.  I love a good cactus.  I think they are these neat, amazing plants that some only bloom once a year, some only once in their life.  But, isn’t that the way life is?  Sometimes, though, given the right mocment, the right condition, we can make that cactus bloom.  I will always carry Indigo Rising and The Healing Room with me as a part of my journey, but it was time for a change. Much like the cactus has to do.</p>
<p>So here we are, with my surname, Cactus Bloom Healing, a part of the Austin Healing Collaborative, based out of Austin, TX.  My goal is to give you the energy you need in your life, to support you being the best you that you can be.  That is what the system of healing I practice is all about.</p>
<p>-Stephanie has been studying this artform for fifteen years, and continues to receive energy healing education from her own teacher. Her favorite services are the Light Activation, Cord Cutting and Energy Body Clearing. Stephanie also enjoys finding all the things vegan Austin has to offer, crafting and spending time with her dogs.</p>
