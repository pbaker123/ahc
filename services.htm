Below you will find a list of all the services we offer as well as what they include. Please note we require clients to schedule an appointment for any services ahead of time.

<h2>Light Activation</h2>
<p>Your spiritual DNA contains the master plan for who you are, your life purpose, and Divine potential. Your DNA determines more than just your genetic makeup – it holds encoded information relative to your spiritual lineage, emotional behavioral patterns, spiritual gifts, and more! The Light Activation is truly an activation: of your life, your potential, your awareness, and more!</p>

<p>Investment: $200 (1-hour session; includes Progression Support, a vibrational elixir)</p>

<h2><br />Jikiden Reiki Healing</h2>
<p>Jikiden simply means “direct lineage” and we practice it as it was originally handed down to Mikao Usui and from him to his first students, without any modification to the methodology. &nbsp;Reiki is a gentle Japanese healing art that works to heal on a physical as well as energetic level.&nbsp; Today, Reiki is widely recognized in North America as a viable form of complementary medicine and is frequently found in hospitals, All living things have an innate ability to heal, it’s simply that blockages get in the way, similar to how trees and rocks can dam up a river and prevent it from flowing as it should.&nbsp; Reiki shifts energy and allows the body to heal itself.</p>
<p>Reiki is a gentle but powerful energy work modality. It has a long history of aiding in healing virtually every known illness including: multiple sclerosis, heart disease, cancer, anxiety, depression, headache, fatigue and&nbsp;insomnia.</p>
<p>Reiki improves medical treatment by reducing negative side effects, shortening healing time, reducing pain and&nbsp;releasing stress. Universal Healing Energy is sent through the practitioner’s hands to assist the client in healing on a physical and emotional level.</p>
<p>Introductory Price: $75 (1 hour)</p>

<h2><br />Ensofic Ray Healing</h2>
<p>The Ensofic Ray healing modality is a beautiful, pure, profound energy system that was originally received by Usui Mikao many years ago on Mount Kurama.&nbsp; However, the system was so powerful that it was put away for many years and in its place Usui Mikao taught the world the partial system, which is the Reiki we know today.&nbsp; Ensofic Ray healing is the full and complete system of what Usui Mikao received on the mountain.</p>
<p>The highest energy available on the planet today, the Ensofic Ray Healing works on the spirit, the soul and the physical body.&nbsp; It originates from the Ensof, the breath of creation.</p>

<p>Investment: $450 (three session protocol)</p>


<h2><br />Crystal Healing</h2>
<p>The healing power of crystals is known around the world through many cultures and belief systems.&nbsp; 3,000 years ago, King Salomon also knew the value of these precious stones and created a wonderful healing technique that we practice to this day.</p>
<p>The practitioner uses various crystals placed on different areas on the body in combination with ancient rituals and sacred mantras to aid in the healing of emotional, mental and physical issues.&nbsp; It works to heal old and new wounds while increasing energy and enhancing time.&nbsp; Crystal healing empowers you to step into a pure mind to increase positive energy flow into your life for good fortune and a general state of well-being.</p>
<p>Investment: $75.00</p>
<h2><br />Emotional Cord Cutting</h2>
<p>Are you having difficulty letting go of a bad situation or an old relationship?&nbsp; Keep reliving the past in your head?&nbsp; A cord cutting may help.</p>
<p>Emotional cords form energetic links between you and other people or situations. Although some cords with children and spouses are appropriate, most of the cords we have are unhealthy and create an unbalanced dependency or co-dependency with other people. Negative cords can form when we have traumatic experiences, or from a sense of betrayal, guilt, blame, anger, depression, or attachment of any kind. Because of its intimacy and intensity, sexual interaction, even a deep kiss, results in being corded for seven years!</p>
<p>When a cord has formed between two people, energy flows between them even if they are no longer in each other’s lives or in physical proximity. If negative emotional patterns are associated with that relationship, person, or experience, your energy and life force can become drained and depleted, keeping you stuck in patterns of the past.</p>
<p>Once your cords are cut through this process, you are free to reconnect with those who are important to you! As a result, you can establish your current relationships on a new and healthier level, with new energy and a new focus.</p>
<p>Investment: $50.00</p>
<h2><br />Aura Healing</h2>
<p>Stress and toxins (caffeine, alcohol, sugar, salt, etc.) can blow holes in your aura, causing you to drain energy. During this session, the healing energy is sent to the aura to bring more light into your body.</p>
<p>Investment: $75.00</p>
