          <p>&quot;I  have known Sandy as both a healer and friend for over 5 years. I have trusted her with my whole being. </p>
          <p> I  think I have experienced every healing modality she offers; from a cord cutting and Light Activation to the Ensofic Ray Healing to the King Solomon Body Region series of healings. </p>
          <p> I have experienced many different types of energy work; I was an acupuncture client for years. What I know about energy  work in general is that we   have to get ourselves out of the way to flow the  Healing Light of God   and His Light Workers. In all my 46 years of experiencing  Light and   energy work, I have never met anyone who is so willing to let go of  the   ego to flow what will do the best work!</p>
          <p> Sandy  is a trusted friend and a gifted   healer. I cannot recommend her enough. Working  with Sandy is a gift you   can give yourself!<br />
            <br />
            Love and light to you, oh lucky new client!&quot;<br />

          <p>&quot;The King Salomon healings, bar none, have   made a  difference.  I feel more in my body, am able to focus and have   more  clarity.  I have done my share of other healing work and this is   the  most beneficial ever. &quot; </p>

          <p>&quot;The emotional cord cutting feels like a sign of relief. I  don't feel as weighed down by negative emotions. </p>
          <p>Their ability to channel healing energy through   the  ensofic ray healing is fantastic. As a reiki practitioner and   healer myself, I  can appreciate the quality of healing energy she is   able to facilitate. I had  an ensofic ray session when I was feeling   anxiety and it shifted me into a  state of trust and acceptance. </p>
          <p>Sandy's background as a counselor and RN   provides her with a  unique and skilled approach to assisting the   client. She's very intuitive and  assists the client with scanning their   energy and getting to what the core is  so the client can shift. Her   approach is always with the empowerment of the  client in mind. She's   very humble, thoughtful and good at what she does!&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;They are very   compassionate and truly care. They has always  taken the time to listen   and I have always felt comfortable receiving healing  work and taking   classes with them. The classes as well as personal healing  sessions   have most certainly helped me with my growth process.&quot;</p>

          <p> “The Initiation of Light class  tremendously   changed my life. When I first took it, I was incredibly depressed  and   hopeless. In the months that passed afterwards, I started noticing that   the  things that would upset me or make me sad just started to shift. I   got off of  my depression medication, and have become truly empowered   from within. I  sometimes can't even believe how much I've changed since   taking the class, and  now look forward with excitement for what the   future holds!”</p>
          <p>DK, Manager,  Atlanta, GA </p>
          <div></div>
          <p>&quot;The Initiation of Light class  completely changed my   life. It afforded me the tools to take personal control  of my own life   and create it how I want it. My ability to manifest has greatly    increased. The best part about the program is, it will positively change   your  life even if you don't actively use the tools - they just help   everything move  faster and exponentially if you put them to work!&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;The Initiation of Light class has  helped me in all   areas of life. It has given me a better understanding of who I  truly   am, it's given me tools to be able to cope with life's twists and turns    more healthily, as well as given me the ability to manifest better. I   have  noticed a great shift in the ability to open my heart up to new   possibilities and  to take chances in order to fulfill myself and my   spirit.&quot; </p>
